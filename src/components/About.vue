            <p class="text-base">Hi there! I'm a Front-End Developer with a unique path to tech. After working as a gardener with my father post-high school, I decided to pivot towards technology. At 29, I began studying Software Engineering, fueling my passion for the digital world. A year into my studies, I jumped at the opportunity to join an intense bootcamp program with Platzi, landing my first tech job shortly thereafter in April 2021.</p>
            <p class="text-base">In the tech industry, learning never stops and I thrive on that. I find it truly fulfilling to use my skills to create things that make people's lives easier. Continually learning and evolving, my goal is to contribute to impactful projects and help shape a better digital world.</p>
